      <h2 className="font-bold flex justify-center">Welcome to my story</h2>
      <h3>Hi, my name is Jaylen and I'm going to tell you my
              story so let's get right into it. So it all started in elementary
              school. I went through school in special classes. Everyone I tell
              that to would always be surprised and say they would have never
              known. Well, that's because I don't have any special needs. So it
              was very embarrassing going to school and having friends that were
              in normal classes, so you can imagine growing up I didn't feel
              very smart.
              <br /> <br /> I went through this from elementary school all the
              way until I graduated high school. By the time I got to high
              school, the classes were not necessarily for special needs but it
              was for kids with learning disabilities. Although I had trouble
              reading and spelling I didn't have a learning disability. I was an
              athlete from elementary school to high school So I had no problem
              having friends but it was still embarrassing that I was never in
              the same class as them.
              <br /> <br /> I grew up with good parents that worked hard to keep
              me out of trouble and keep me focused but they did not know that I
              had the thoughts of not feeling smart or through school. big
              accomplishment was graduating considering it didn't feel like an
              accomplishment because I wasn't challenged going through school.</h3>

              <h3 className="font-bold flex justify-center">The Move To Greenville</h3>
              <h3>ow that I have graduated and trying to figure out
              what is next for me I attended college but instantly College was
              not for me. So I dropped out of college and I moved to Greenville
              South Carolina with my dad to work. I also tried to start my
              clothing line where I taught myself how to do graphic design to
              make my designs on my clothing. I liked doing graphic design so
              after a few years of teaching myself I finally decided that I
              needed to attend college I was in college for about two and a half
              years and realized I was learning everything I already knew in
              that job and didn't care about my degree in that field so I
              dropped out I also got burned out from graphic design and decided
              that I will use it as just a hobby. Moving to Greenville was the
              best decision of my life. I learned a lot from a lot of people.
              the biggest lesson that I learned was from my wife whom I met in
              Greenville. She has taught me a lot and brought a lot of new
              things into my life. <br /> <br /> but the biggest change she
              brought into my life was the world of tech. My wife was the very
              first one and told me that I would be good at software
              development. I didn't listen because I still didn't feel smart
              enough. but I met someone who was in the same field and had been
              doing software development for about 6 years and he taught me a
              little bit of HTML After that I joined a foundation course that
              taught me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript., the foundation's course was
              a confirmation that I actually could be good at this. So I joined
              the cohort and became cohort 18. Throughout the class, I felt like
              I was where I needed to be but still wasn't sure if I was going to
              come out at the end of this cohort. but my teacher was a perfect
              teacher for me. He made the class fun to be in and that made it
              easier to understand the languages. The best teacher is a teacher
              who believes in his/her students. My teacher Sean believed in us.{" "}
              <br /> <br /> Throughout the cohort, there were ups and downs but
              I made it to demo day my demo day was fantastic I got a lot of
              good feedback on the app that I made Now I am realizing that I am
              good at software development after our demo day the cohort went
              out for dinner and that is where we received our certificate and
              at this moment I am getting my clarity that I am smart And I can
              be proud of what I've just done which is learning six different
              development languages in only 3 months I can finally be proud of
              myself in hold my head high.</h3>

              <h3>That is my story on why becoming Carolina Code School cohort
              18 has made me the happiest I've ever been other than having my
              very own family.</h3>
